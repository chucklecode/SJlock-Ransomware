# SJlock-Ransomware
This ransomware is built with a super encryption mechanism and can encrypt all types of files in a system or network with a single click. 

SJlock Ransomware locks all the file type on the target computer and then display a GUI (Graphical User Interface) with details on how to pay the ransom, give a time limit for the ransom to be paid, leave a message on how the ransom should be paid, display a BTC (Bitcoin) address where the ransom should be paid and then the equivalent to US Dollar, and then finally leave a threatning message to the target if the time limit has passed.

SJLOCK Ransomware will send a decryption key back to an email address which the software will request you to put. 



Once the decryption is sent back to you, you have the power now to choose if to send it back to the target after he has paid the ransom or not to send it back again to them. 

If you choose to send the decryption key back to the target, you have to send it back with the decryption SJLOCK app, which will be provided to you after you order the software.

SJLOCK RANSOMWARE IS VERY STRONG AND DANGEROUS AS THEIR IS NO MECHANISM TO RECOVER A FILE THAT IS ENCRYPTED WITH SJLOCK RANSOMWARE WITHOUT THE DECRYPTION KEY OR THE DECRYPTION APP. 

ONCE YOUR ORDER IS RECEIVED WHEN YOU ORDER THE SJLOCK RANSOMWARE WE WILL SEND YOU BOTH THE PDF FILE AND VIDEO FILE TO HELP YOU SET IT UP AND GET IT WORKING.
